Instructions on how to install and configure the edit term module 
f Drupal 5:

INSTALLATION:

Step 0)
  Have a working installation of Drupal.  See http://drupal.org/project/drupal

Step 1)
  Copy the 'edit_term.module', 'edit_term.install', and
'edit_term.info' files within their 'taxonomy_install' subdirectory 
into your 'modules', 'sites/all/modules', or site-specific modules directory.
  Drupal ninjas can automate installation with http://drupal.org/project/drush

Step 2)
  Enable the edit_term module.  
  Go to "Administer >> Build >> Modules" and put a checkmark in the 'status' 
column next to 'edit_term'. 

Step 3)
  Check new functionality. When viewing a term (on a taxonomy/term/edit page)
  you should see a new option in the tabs: 'Edit Term' (or Gallery) which will
  link directly to an equivalent of the the admin/content/taxonomy/edit/term/n
  interface.
  On that page you will also see edit fields for aliases and menu creation to
  represent a term view.
