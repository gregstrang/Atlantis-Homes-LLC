- @dman
fixed some major bad indentation
adjusted to use taxonomy_term_path - which should make it work better with image gallery and forum taxonomies
adjusted to use hook_term_alter instead of the over-ride hack it was using before
Tested lots on the new D6 menu system - it was quite different, but got the parent selector sorted out again.
Removed menu field descriptions because they are boring.
Adjusted form weightings
